# **DATA-X:** <br>  m420 - BREAD &amp; BUTTER DEEP LEARNING - REGRESSION AND CLASSIFICATION USING TENSORFLOW v2 AND LUDWIG

<br>


<br>



**Author List (in no particular order):** [Elias Castro Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehcastroh/), [Ikhlaq Sidhu](https://ikhlaq-sidhu.com/), and [Debbie Yuen](http://www.debbiecyuen.me/). 

**About (TL/DR):** Tensorflow (TF) is an open-source library used for dataflow, differentiable programming, symbolic math, and machine learning applications such as deep learning neural networks. [Ludwig](https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/index.html) is a toolbox built atop TF that enables users the ability to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code.

**Learning Goal(s):** This notebook covers advanced topics in machine learning. However, it does not require any prior knowledge in machine learning. The goal of this notebook is to teach a user how to deploy deep learning regression and classification models, using structured data. This task is so common to machine learning, that it is pretty much the bread and butter of ML engineers. 

**Associated Materials:** To ease the learning curve, we encourage the user of this notebook to visit the [Data-X](https://datax.berkeley.edu/) site for resources on fundamentals of machine learning, and an introductoin to TensorFlow v2.

**Keywords (Tags):** tensorflow, tensor-flow, tensorflow-tutorial, deep-learning, deep-learning-with-python, neural-networks, Ludwig, deep-learning-toolbox, data-x, uc-berkeley-engineering 

**Prerequisite Knowledge:** (1) Python, (2) Pandas, (3) Matplotlib, (4) TensorFlow v2 

**Target User:** Data scientists, applied machine learning engineers, and developers
